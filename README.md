# NotificationOpenDialogActivity
This small example demonstrate that a notification clicked by user then application will open dialogActivity. If you want AlertDialog functionality then this example can help you.



If you want similar functionality like AlertDialog then you can also achieve that by using Dialog Acitvity. I have wrote small code which can demonstrate what you exactly want in your question. I have attached links of github and gif video which visualize what I did in the code.
